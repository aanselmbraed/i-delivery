    <h1>THE POWER OF THE WORD</h1>
    The world is formed by the word of God and the word of God is the authentic source of power. Each day has some forces
    of darkness, set out to stop the loaded blessings of the day... Until you- arise- NO GLORY! for this book of the law 
    shall not depart out of thy mouth, thou shall meditate therein day and night... In the word lies success, breakthrough,
    life, power, favour etc. Therefore be encouraged to wake up, and have a separate time with your God each day before leaving
    the house. Open your bible with your daily guide, recieve from God- the strategic way to move and make profiting.

      <h2 style="color: red;">*HOW TO READ*</h2>
     (1) if you have to move out by 6am. wake up by 5am. Enter His getes with thanksgiving, (i.e. gates of success, breakthrough,
     life, and deliverance from evil)etc. Whatever desire that you need. enter His gates with thanksgiving, by singing some praises
     to Him, not complanining songs rather, songs of praises.
     <br><br>
     (2) Open your mouth, and thank Him for a new day. There is a drug for slepping, but no drug can wake you up. So, that you sleep
     and wake up. it is just because the Lord sustains you. Psaim 3vs5.
     <br><br>
     (3) Sat down, pick up your bible (the manual of life) open your daily guide - read the passage and recieve God's council
     for the day. Before reading, have this in mind, you are not readind ordinary novel rather - a spiritual book. Therefore call
     the author to help interpret what He wrote to you, the author of the scripture is the holy ghost. Welcome him for you to
     behold wondrous things of His word written therein.
